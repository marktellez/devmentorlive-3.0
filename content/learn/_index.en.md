Hello! My name is ***_Marcus Tellez_*** and I am a ***_Sr. Software Engineer_*** specializing in ***_web development_***, and an ***_AI Researcher_***, currently focusing on machine learning via **_Large Language Models_**.

On this website, I write **_programmer-focused_** articles on _tools_, _productivity_, _clarity_, and _code beauty_. Topics include **_refactoring_**, **_design patterns_**, **_clean code_**, **_abstraction_**, **_functional programming_**, and using tools like **_ChatGPT_** to increase **_productivity_**.

I am known for writing **_human-readable_**, clean code, using **_JavaScript_**, **_NextJS_**, and **_ReactJS_**. I am pretty fond of **_MongoDB_** and **_Pinecone_**, and I have been an expert on **_Relational Databases_** like _Postgres_ for many years.
